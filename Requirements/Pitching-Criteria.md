## Pitch Readiness Checklist

- [ ] **AI Innovation (35 pts)**
  - [ ] Clearly defined AI components (models, retrieval, tools/APIs)
  - [ ] Demonstrable innovation vs baseline / obvious solution
  - [ ] Unique angle on the voicemail problem (e.g., multilingual slang robustness, clever guardrails)
  - [ ] Storyline that highlights *why* the AI approach is special

- [ ] **Functionality (25 pts)**
  - [ ] Core intents (`deactivate_voicemail`, `query_voicemail_info`, etc.) work end-to-end
  - [ ] Slot extraction and validation flows are robust (phone, PIN/OTP, language)
  - [ ] CRM API integration and audit logging function without critical bugs
  - [ ] Guardrails and safety behaviors are verifiably working in the demo

- [ ] **Live Demonstration (20 pts)**
  - [ ] Simple, intuitive user flow for the judge demo (no extra clicks/screens)
  - [ ] UI/UX clearly shows what the AI is doing (e.g., detected intent, slots, tool calls)
  - [ ] Demo script with 3–6 well-chosen scenarios (happy path, edge cases, guardrails)
  - [ ] Backup plan if connectivity or one component fails (graceful degradation)

- [ ] **Quality (10 pts)**
  - [ ] Architecture diagram prepared (data flow: user → NLU → KB/CRM → response)
  - [ ] Clear explanation of how the solution could scale in production
  - [ ] Code and configuration organized (easy to extend and maintain)
  - [ ] Risks and technical trade-offs understood and articulated

- [ ] **Presentation (10 pts)**
  - [ ] 3–5 key slides: problem, solution, AI magic, impact/metrics, roadmap
  - [ ] Value proposition stated in one clear sentence
  - [ ] Roles for each team member during pitch and demo are defined
  - [ ] Timing rehearsed to fit total pitch + demo window
